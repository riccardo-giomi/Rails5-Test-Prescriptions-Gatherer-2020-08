# README

This is the "Gatherer" Rails application for the book **"Rails 5 Test Prescriptions: building a better codebase," by Noel Rappin.**
The Agile Ventures book group is working through the book together starting in August, 2020.

Some gems in this project are later versions than the ones specified in the book. (TODO: _because_....)  
Most importantly, the book uses for Rails 5.2, but this repository uses **Rails 6.0.3.2.**

### Organization: Branches for the Chapters

There is a branch for each chapter, starting with chapter 2 (when the 'gatherer' project is first introduced).
Each branch follows the naming convention "chapter-_nn_-start", where _'nn'_ is the chapter number.
Each branch has the code for the _start_ of the chapter.

### Requirements

- Rails 6.0.3.2

- Ruby version 2.7.1

- SQLite3

- RSpec gems version 3.9
